# wearPuck
Open Source Sensing Platform based on the [Espruino Puck](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js#pinout), using additional sensors such as the athmospheric [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) sensors for extra information, wrapped up in a wrist-worn prototype. 

The encasing is based on the [design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2095572) by [MaBecker](https://www.thingiverse.com/mabecker/designs), licensed under the [Creative Commons - Public Domain Dedication license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
