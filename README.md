# wearPuck
Open Source Sensing Platform based on the [Espruino Puck](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js#pinout), using additional sensors such as the athmospheric [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) sensors for extra information, wrapped up in a wrist-worn prototype.
